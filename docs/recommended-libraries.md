- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand): Super handy library for global state management with a comfy api based on hooks.
- [GraphQL Code Generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/): Is a plugin-based tool that helps you get the best out of your GraphQL stack, we use it mostly to generate TypeScript types based on our queries mutations and fragments.
